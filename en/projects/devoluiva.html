                    <p>
                        DevoluIVA offers an enterprise service which consists of a network of existing establishments 
			where employees and freelancers usually make small expenses,  like restaurants, taxis and gas 
			stations. Users can recuperate the VAT automatically by photographing their receipt, which 
			generates an invoice. Receipts of businesses that are not part of the network can still be 
			photographed and managed in the app, but will not lead to an invoice.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>UX has never been tested before</h2>
                    <p>
                        DevoluIVA's mean rating is 60/100, so the company wanted to know why and how to improve it. 
			The app was launched in 2014, but the user experience has never been tested.
		    </p>
		    <br />
		    <p>
			Therefore, we dove deeper into this unknown user experience and figure out the actual user 
			frustrations and needs in order to define the problems.

                    <p>
                        We followed the HCD process by first conducting user research to investigate how 
			    DevoluIVA users interact with the app so we could discover the current issues. 
			    After synthesizing inspiring insights from survey, usability testing and interviews, 
			    we defined the problem and jumped right into the ideation phase, where we brainstormed 
			    and designed multiple solutions. From sketches all the way to fidelity prototypes, we 
			    gradually created the solution for the application.

                        We sent a survey to our client before starting our research because we wanted to 
			    understand their vision and objectives. Meanwhile, we sounded out the app in 
			    order to evaluate the project scope. Afterwards, we had the kick-off meeting 
			    were we aligned goals and deadlines.

                    <p>
                        There are similar products like DevoluIVA, although not entirely. Its distinguishing trait 
			is the way they recuperate VAT through their establishment network. Therefore DevoluIVA application is composed of two parts: 
		    <ul>
			    <li><stan>It’s an <strong>expense management app</strong></stan></li>
			    <li><stan>It’s an <strong>establishment finder</strong>, linked to the app’s large network of establishments.</stan></li>
		    </ul>
		    </p>
		    <br />
		    <p>
			So we divided the competitive analysis in 2 areas among 5 direct competitors. 
			For the first case, we chose Captio and Expensify, for the second one, Google Maps, Tripadvisor and El Tenedor.

                        <li><span>A need for functionalities that make up the new industry standards,

                        <li><span>Provide a search function with an autosuggestion feature and feedback in case of errors.</span></li>
                        <li><span>A use of a warmer tone of copy.</span></li>

                    <h3>How can we fix fast with low cost and high impact?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We performed an heuristic evaluation and we found out there were 62 hypothesis that were infringing on usability. 
			We ranked and prioritized them according to severity to sort and validate the most important ones.
		    </p>
		    <br />
		    <p>	
			Based on what we found out in the meeting with Stakeholders, we could have in mind our 
			proto-persona in order to conduct the "guerrilla" tests.
                    </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>The main concerns we were able to validate with usability guerrilla tests were 5:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>Navigation</strong> - Too many information and micro-interactions on the main. Less is more.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Confusing search fields</strong> - Filters needed to be updated with current material design.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>No user control and freedom</strong> - Users couldn’t delete or edit data once created.</span></li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                <strong>Mising documentation</strong> - There was key-information that was provided 
				    directly to the email or in the webside FAQ‘s section, but not in the mobile app.
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span><strong>Iconography</strong> - Some weren’t clear enough and it was confusing 
				to see an icon used for different purposes throughout the app.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br />
                    <p>The main hypotheses we found out with the heuristic accessibility evaluation were 5:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>The images and buttons did not have an appropriate alternative text when using a screen reader.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Some pop-up messages were not detectable when using a screen magnifier or screen reader.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Some buttons were too small for big or shaky fingers.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Colour contrast wasn’t always optimal.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Certain action buttons were too far from it’s related text when using a screen magnifier.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br />
                    <h3>Usability lab study</h3>

                    <p>
                        We were aware about the main usability issues, but we needed to dig more into the target 
			users experience and their needs. 
		    </p>
		    <br />
		    <p>	
			We took <strong>10 test de 10 user tests and interviews</strong>  in a lab study. 
			    We scheduled, executed and synthetized the results in 3 weeks.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        We defined the most critical use cases in order to evaluate the user experience. 
			    We wanted to know if the app was clear enough or needed an onboarding was required or 
			    not, therefor we chose, between those 10 users, 5 new and 5 regular profiles.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The newest insights highlighted were:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>Users need more information about the restaurants</strong>, 
				like pictures about the place and meal, prices, business time, rating, menu...</span></li>
                        <li><span>Need of new feature - <strong>To create and send reports through the app</strong>. 
				It was only available in desktop solution.</span></li>
                        <li><span>There were basic functions unknown by regular users - <strong> Need of onboarding.</strong></span></li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                <strong>
                                    Employees prefer to use Google Maps, insted of DevoluIVA's network and they don't care about VAT return,
                                </strong> they just want to log their expenses. This is quite important as it has a direct link with the app’s return on investment.
                            </span>
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Between Web Analytics and the tests, we coud see that the establishment 
			network is a critical KPI, because it provides half of the revenue.  Therefore...

                        DevoluIVAs network must offer something that Google Map hasn't got and 
			    provide more freedom to his users. We came up with a solution through 
			    <strong>design thinking</strong> that will provide a sense of DevoluIVA community. 
			    Employees would be able to create fav lists and evaluate the restaurants, 
			    like which restaurants are good to go on a meeting, alone, with the team.

                        We sketched possible solutions to fix usability problems that we have observed 
			    before reaching a more solid solution (wireframes). We took on a commitment 
			    to develop a simple and minimalist design.

                    <p>
                        One of the most significant decisions was to replace the top app bar for the 
			    bottom navigation bar. There were several reasons such as, gaining flexibility 
			    and efficiency, preserving the establishment finder importance and trying to 
			    make it easier to access and use. Moreover, Stakeholders wanted that users 
			    could reach to every single functions in just one-click.

                        An area where we feel we were not entirely successful was the system to 
			    encourage employees to use DevoluIVA’s establishment network. It is 
			    required that users feed the system to recommend restaurants. However, 
			    users don't always give a compliment even when they liked the restaurant, 
			    and don't a big incentive to choose the network's establishments either. 
			    Additional exploration was deprioritized due to time constraints. As a 
			    future study topic, this could be very interesting to investigate deeply 
			    due to its importance to DevoluIVA’s KPI.
